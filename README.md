# NIST Dataset P-T analysis

Curve-fitting of vapor pressure and temperature to automatically calculate Antoine's Coefficients A, B and C.

It uses Scipy (curve_fit), Pandas & Numpy, Matplotlib, Pathlib, datetime and openpyxl

When executing the script, it asks for 3 numerical inputs. Each of those inputs are 3 first guesses of the 3 Antoine's Coefficients.

Inside of folder 'datos', there must be 2 folders: 'input' & 'output'.
In the same folder as 'datos', there must be the folder 'src' with the python script inside.
The content of the input folder are .txt files that have a specific format: Substance_Name.txt

From folder 'src' execute 'Exploracion de Datos NIST', the program will use the data in a .txt format that is saved in a folder named input.
The results will be saved automatically in another folder named output.
The data used must consist of a column named Temperature (K), and a second column named Pressure (MPa) separated with a tab \t so the script detects and uses the data.
The outputs are in .txt, .png, and .xlsx format. (3 outputs per substance)

Developed to optimize data analysis processes in Chemical Engineering.
